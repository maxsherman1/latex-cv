	\begin{letter}{Hiring Team \\ Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd \\ Banbury Road \\ Gaydon, Warwickshire \\ CV35 0DB \\ United Kingdom}
		
		\opening{Dear Hiring Team,}
		
		I am writing to apply for the Software \& Electronics Technologies Graduate Engineer position at Aston Martin. As a Computer Science graduate from the University of Brighton with an industrial placement at Jaguar Land Rover, I am eager to contribute my technical expertise and enthusiasm for automotive innovation to Aston Martin's mission of building the world's most desirable ultra-luxury performance vehicles.
		
		During my year-long placement with Jaguar Land Rover, I developed and optimised AUTOSAR-compliant Simulink models for control systems, improving model efficiency and maintainability by over 60\%. Demonstrating initiative and a strong capacity for rapid learning, I was promoted to Function Owner within six months, leading a small team to develop, calibrate, and validate embedded software. This experience deepened my understanding of automotive software development and its complexities, whilst further fuelling my curiosity for cutting-edge automotive innovation. 
		
		Beyond my technical contributions, I actively sought opportunities to challenge myself and support others. As a team lead in the DRIVEN project, an early-careers initiative at JLR, I oversaw the design, development, testing, and integration of control software for a Greenpower Formula 24 racecar. I implemented industry-standard practices such as Agile methodology, JIRA, and GitLab, and was recognised with two "Amped-Up" awards for exceptional leadership and dedication. Through this role, I strengthened my leadership and accountability skills, promoting open collaboration and feedback whilst consistently delivering results under tight deadlines. 
		
		My academic background complements this practical experience. I have built a strong foundation in software engineering and data science, achieving a first-class GPA of 80\%. My final-year project, an F1 Data Analysis Tool built in Python, reflects my long-standing passion for motorsport and innovation through software.
		
		Aston Martin's values resonate deeply with my approach to engineering and collaboration. I am inspired by your belief that "no one builds an Aston Martin on their own" and I am eager to contribute to that collective pursuit of precision, performance, and craftsmanship. The rotational nature of this programme especially appeals to me, as it provides the ideal environment to learn, grow, and contribute across areas such as connected car systems, motion control, and autonomous functions.
		
		I would be honoured to bring my technical skills, problem-solving ability, and enthusiasm for automotive innovation to Aston Martin. Thank you for considering my application.

		\closing{Yours sincerely,}
